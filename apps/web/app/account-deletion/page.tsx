          You can permanently delete your Reqraft account — created on the web at reqraft.in or
          through the Reqraft mobile app — at any time. This page explains how to do it, what data
          is removed, and what happens to content in organizations you share with other people.

        <p>
          Content created inside an organization belongs to that organization. If you are a member
          of an organization that has other members, the organization and its work products
          (projects, features, PRDs, tasks) are not deleted — your membership is removed and items
          you authored remain with the organization, attributed to another member. If you are the
          only owner of an organization that still has other members, you must transfer ownership
          (or remove those members) before your account can be deleted.

        <p>
          Deleted data is removed from our production systems immediately. Residual copies may
          persist in encrypted backups for up to 30 days before being purged, and we may retain
          limited records where the law requires it (for example, billing and tax records held by
          our payment provider).
